# It demonstrates the capabilities that orogen has to marshal opaque types
# through a user-provided intermediate type. In this test, a
# NotOrogenCompatible::Point2D type is defined, that is unknown to orogen. Then,
# the user provides an intermediate type (TestOpaque::Point2D) that can be
# handled by orogen, and the user provides convertion functions between those
# types (see toolkit/*User.*).
