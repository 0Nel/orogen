Orogen depends on the following libraries:
 - util.rb, a Ruby toolkit. It is available as a gem.
 - the Typelib library. This a C++ library with Ruby bindings. See
   typelib.sourceforge.net for installation instructions. Make sure you are
   building the Ruby bindings.
 - util--, a C++ toolkit. See utilmm.sourceforge.net for installation
   instructions.

Generated modules of course depend on the Orocos Realtime Toolkit (RTT). Having
enabled CORBA support in the RTT is optional. Moreover, they depend on the
following libraries:
 - typelib, which is already a dependency of orogen itself
